### Executive Summary
Analyze Fetch data from user, products, and transaction CSVs provided in order to answer three of the following six questions.

Closed-ended questions:
- 1a. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
- 2a. What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
- 3a. What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.
- 1b. Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
- 2b. Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
- 3b. At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?

### Exploration, Observation, Validations, and Assumptions
All analyzed using Python via Jupyter notebook. Notebook available via Github [HERE](https://github.com/david423br/druiz_fetch_da_assess/tree/main/notebook).

### Data Source
To answer these questions, I used the following data retrieved from [Fetch Data Analyst Takehome Assessment](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/data-analyst/da_take_home/da_takehome_instructions.html)
- user
- products
- transaction

### Analytical Approach
#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Exporatory analysis via Python using Jupyter Notebook - [Can be viewed HERE](https://github.com/david423br/druiz_fetch_da_assess/tree/main/notebook)
- Data analysis via PostgreSQL using PGAdmin to answer provided questions - [Can be viewed HERE](https://github.com/david423br/druiz_fetch_da_assess/tree/main/sql_script)

#### Known Issues and Challenges
The data provided was pretty sound, not much cleaning necessary, but there are a few data rows that were excluded based on the following criteria:
- FINAL_SALE column in 'transaction' dataset included empty cells
- FINAL_QUANTITY column in 'transaction' dataset included the non-numeric word 'zero'

These observations, exclusions, and assumptions are explained inline in both my Python exploratory analysis, and my SQL data analysis.

### Tools Used
- `Python/Pandas` - for exploration of the data

- `PostgreSQL` - for analysis of the data necessary to answer provided questions

- `Git` - for version control
